- each header should be able to be used independently from others
--> include all dependencies needed
--> avoid double inclusions by using include guards (?)

ex00:
- all functions should print, even constructor and destructor
- go hard on the tests

ex01:
- ScavTrap will inherit the constructors and deconstructor
- they and attack() should print different messages
- construction/destruction chaining must be shown
