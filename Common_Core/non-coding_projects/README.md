## Introduction

While the majority of projects in the 42 curriculum involve coding in C and similar programming languages, there are several projects that explore other subjects. Although I cannot share my specific solutions to these projects here, I will briefly introduce them to highlight my experience and expertise in these areas.

## Projects

### Born2beroot

The Born2beroot project serves as an intensive system administration exercise, designed to immerse participants in the essentials of virtualization and server management. By guiding users through the creation of a virtual machine using VirtualBox, the project introduces the foundational concepts of virtualization. Emphasis is placed on setting up an operating system under strict guidelines, ensuring that participants gain practical experience in configuring and securing a server environment from the ground up. This structured approach not only highlights the importance of adhering to best practices in system administration but also equips users with the skills necessary to manage complex virtualized environments.

#### Requirements

    Setup of a server with the minimum necessary services and no graphical interface.
    Choice of operating system: latest stable version of Debian.
    Configuration of encrypted partitions using LVM.
    Setup and configuration of SSH, UFW/firewalld firewall, hostname, user accounts, strong password policy, and sudo rules.
    Creation of a monitoring script (monitoring.sh) to display system information at regular intervals.

#### Key Learnings

    Virtualization Fundamentals
        Understanding how to create and manage virtual machines using VirtualBox or UTM.
        Learning the importance of virtual environments in system administration.

    Operating System Configuration
        Gaining hands-on experience with installing and configuring Debian.
        Setting up and managing encrypted partitions using LVM.

    Security Practices
        Implementing a robust SSH setup to enhance security.
        Configuring UFW or firewalld to manage firewall rules effectively.
        Enforcing a strong password policy to ensure user account security.
        Setting up and securing sudo access to limit the potential impact of unauthorized access.

    Automation and Scripting
        Writing a bash script (monitoring.sh) to monitor and report system status, enhancing the ability to automate routine tasks.
        Understanding and utilizing cron jobs to schedule regular script execution.

    System Monitoring and Maintenance
        Learning to monitor critical system parameters such as CPU, memory, and disk usage.
        Tracking user activity and system uptime to ensure smooth operation and quick issue resolution.

    Practical Problem-Solving
        Developing the ability to troubleshoot and resolve configuration issues.
        Enhancing problem-solving skills through practical, hands-on tasks and real-time debugging.

By completing the Born2beroot project, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of system administration, improved my ability to configure and secure operating systems, and developed essential skills in virtualization, automation, and system monitoring. These experiences have equipped me with the foundational knowledge required to manage and maintain servers in a professional environment.

### NetPractice

The NetPractice project is designed as an immersive networking exercise aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of networking fundamentals. Through a series of practical exercises, participants are introduced to the core concepts of networking, with a particular focus on configuring small-scale networks. This hands-on approach emphasizes the importance of mastering TCP/IP addressing, enabling participants to gain valuable experience in setting up and managing network configurations effectively.

#### Requirements
    Completion of 10 levels, each with a specific networking problem to solve.
    Use of a web-based training interface to simulate network configurations.
    For each level:
        Analyze a non-functioning network diagram.
        Solve the specified issues to make the network run correctly.
        Use "Check again" to verify configurations and "Get my config" to download configurations.
        Export and save the configuration after completing each level.
    Understanding and applying TCP/IP addressing concepts to achieve correct network configurations.

#### Key Learnings

    Networking Fundamentals
        Gained a thorough understanding of TCP/IP addressing and subnetting.
        Learned the importance of correct IP address allocation and subnet mask configuration.

    Practical Network Configuration
        Hands-on experience with configuring routers, switches, and other network devices.
        Ability to diagnose and resolve network issues through practical exercises.

    Problem-Solving Skills
        Developed analytical skills by identifying and correcting network configuration errors.
        Improved ability to systematically troubleshoot network problems using logs and other diagnostic tools.

By completing the NetPractice project, I have acquired essential networking skills, including configuring and troubleshooting small-scale networks, understanding TCP/IP addressing, and using simulation tools for practical learning. These experiences have prepared me to handle real-world networking challenges with confidence and precision.
