## Introduction

This repository showcases the various projects I have completed as part of the 42 Common Core curriculum. Each project focuses on different aspects of programming and computer science, allowing me to develop a broad range of skills. These projects are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.
