## Introduction

This repository showcases the various projects I have completed as part of the 42 Common Core curriculum. Each project focuses on different aspects of programming and computer science, allowing me to develop a broad range of skills. These projects are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.


## Projects

### Libft

Description: The Libft project involves recreating several standard C library functions from scratch.

Skills Learned:

    Implementation of standard library functions
    Memory management
    String and data manipulation
    Data structures (linked lists, etc.)

Repository: [Libft](Common_Core/Libft)


### ft_printf

Description: The ft_printf project involves creating a custom implementation of the printf function.

Skills Learned:

    Variadic functions
    Formatted output
    Handling various data types

Repository: [ft_printf](Common_Core/ft_printf)


### get_next_line

Description: The get_next_line project focuses on reading a line from a file descriptor.

Skills Learned:

    File I/O operations
    Buffer management
    Efficient data handling

Repository: [get_next_line](Common_Core/get_next_line)


### push_swap

Description: The push_swap project involves creating a sorting algorithm using a limited set of operations on a stack data structure.

Skills Learned:

    Algorithmic thinking
    Problem-solving
    Stack data structure

Repository: [push_swap](Common_Core/push_swap)
<!-- add explanation of usage and result -->


### pipex

Description: The pipex project involves creating a simplified version of the Unix pipeline.

Skills Learned:

    Process creation
    Inter-process communication
    Handling pipes

Repository: [pipex](Common_Core/pipex)
<!-- add syntax: ./pipex infile "cmd" "cmd" outfile -->


### fract-ol

Description: The fract-ol project involves creating fractal images.

Skills Learned:

    Graphics programming
    Mathematical concepts
    Optimization techniques

Repository: [fract-ol](Common_Core/fract-ol)
<!-- add how to use (keys and mouse) -->
<!-- add how get and use minilibx -->

### philosophers

Description: The philosophers project involves solving the classic dining philosophers problem.

Skills Learned:

    Concurrency
    Threading
    Synchronization

Repository: [philosophers](Common_Core/philosophers)
<!-- add instructions on how to use mealcount -->
