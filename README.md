**Introduction**

This repository showcases the various projects I have completed as part of the 42 Common Core curriculum. Each project focuses on different aspects of programming and computer science, allowing me to develop a broad range of skills. These projects are designed to be challenging and require a deep understanding of the underlying concepts.

**Projects**

Libft

Description: The Libft project involves recreating several standard C library functions from scratch. This project helped me understand the inner workings of commonly used functions and improved my understanding of memory management, string manipulation, and data structures.

Skills Learned:

    Implementation of standard library functions
    Memory management
    String and data manipulation
    Data structures (linked lists, etc.)

Repository: Libft

ft_printf

Description: The ft_printf project involves creating a custom implementation of the printf function. This project taught me about variadic functions, formatted output, and handling different data types.

Skills Learned:

    Variadic functions
    Formatted output
    Handling various data types

Repository: ft_printf

get_next_line

Description: The get_next_line project focuses on reading a line from a file descriptor. This project improved my understanding of file I/O, buffer management, and efficient data handling.

Skills Learned:

    File I/O operations
    Buffer management
    Efficient data handling

Repository: get_next_line

Born2beroot

Description: The Born2beroot project involves setting up a virtual machine and configuring it to be secure and efficient. This project introduced me to system administration, operating systems, and network security.

Skills Learned:

    System administration
    Operating systems
    Network security

Repository: Born2beroot

push_swap

Description: The push_swap project involves creating a sorting algorithm using a limited set of operations on a stack data structure. This project enhanced my algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

Skills Learned:

    Algorithmic thinking
    Problem-solving
    Stack data structure

Repository: push_swap

pipex

Description: The pipex project involves creating a simplified version of the Unix pipeline. This project helped me understand process creation, inter-process communication, and handling pipes.

Skills Learned:

    Process creation
    Inter-process communication
    Handling pipes

Repository: pipex

fract-ol

Description: The fract-ol project involves creating fractal images. This project introduced me to graphics programming, mathematical concepts, and optimization techniques.

Skills Learned:

    Graphics programming
    Mathematical concepts
    Optimization techniques

Repository: fract-ol

philosophers

Description: The philosophers project involves solving the classic dining philosophers problem. This project helped me understand concurrency, threading, and synchronization.

Skills Learned:

    Concurrency
    Threading
    Synchronization

Repository: philosophers

NetPractice

Description: The NetPractice project involves configuring and troubleshooting a small network. This project enhanced my knowledge of networking principles, IP addressing, and routing.

Skills Learned:

    Networking principles
    IP addressing
    Routing

Repository: NetPractice
